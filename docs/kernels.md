# The compiler and the reference ops

`src/compiler/` turns neural-network layers into TPU programs. `src/ref/` computes the same results as plain loops, and the tests require the two to agree bit for bit.

## A layer

```cpp
Layer l;
l.weights  = random_matrix(300, 280, 24);   // K inputs x N outputs, int8
l.shift    = 10;                             // Activate reads each sum as sum / 2^10
l.function = ActivationFunction::Relu;
Compiled c = compile_layers(input, {l});     // input: M rows (examples or pixels) x K columns
```

`compile_layers` chains any number of layers. Each layer's output stays in the Unified Buffer and becomes the next layer's input, and only the last layer's output goes back to the host. `read_result(tpu.host(), c)` reads it back.

## Memory layout

- **Column blocks.** A matrix is stored in 256-wide column blocks, each block holding every row. Block b covers columns 256·b to 256·b + 255, zero-padded at the edge. This matches the machine: one row of a block is one MXU input vector.
- **Host memory.** The input's blocks go at host row 0, one after another, and the result's blocks follow right after.
- **Unified Buffer.** The input and each layer's output get their own region, one after another.
- **Weight Memory.** A K × N weight matrix is cut into 256 × 256 tiles, zero-padded. Tiles are stored in the order the multiplies use them.

## The instruction schedule

For each layer, each output block gets one multiply per input block, all adding into the same accumulator rows, then one `Activate`:

```
Read_Weights ×4                          start the slow DDR3 fetches at once, alongside the PCIe input
Read_Host_Memory (each input block)
for each layer, for each output block nb:
    for each input block kb:
        MatrixMultiply  ub=input block kb, acc=buffer, accumulate=(kb > 0), new_weights=1
        Read_Weights    (the tile 4 multiplies ahead)
    Activate            acc=buffer → ub=output block nb
Write_Host_Memory (each result block)
Halt
```

Three choices make it overlap:
- **Prefetching 4 tiles ahead.** The FIFO holds 4 tiles, so each new `Read_Weights` goes in right after the multiply that frees a slot. The DDR3 channel never waits on an instruction.
- **`accumulate` chains the input blocks.** An input wider than 256 becomes several multiplies adding into the same accumulator rows, and one `Activate` reads the finished sum.
- **Double-buffered accumulators.** When a layer has at most 2,048 rows, consecutive output blocks alternate between the two halves of the accumulators. The next block's multiplies then fill one half while `Activate` drains the other. The machine's interlocks keep this correct without any `Sync`.

A layer can have at most 4,096 rows (all of the accumulators). The compiler reports shapes that don't fit, such as `layer 0: its weights have 65 rows but its input has 64 columns`.

## Convolutions

`compile_conv(image, height, width, kernel, layer)` runs a stride-1, unpadded convolution:
1. **im2col on the host.** The image, stored one pixel per row with channels across, is rearranged into one row per output pixel. Each row holds that pixel's kernel × kernel window, ordered as column (dy·kernel + dx)·channels + c.
2. **One layer on the TPU.** The rearranged matrix is multiplied by the filters, which is exactly the convolution.
3. **Pooling in the Activate.** With `layer.pool` set, the compiler fills in the output map's width, and the activation unit pools as it writes.

## The reference ops

`ref_matmul`, `ref_activate`, `ref_pool` and `ref_conv2d` are plain nested loops with no timing. They're written apart from the simulator so that agreement means something:
- **Rounding:** `ref_activate` rounds with `std::llround` on a double, where the activation unit uses integer shifts.
- **Convolution:** `ref_conv2d` convolves directly, with no im2col.

The tests check each one by hand on small cases, and sweep `ref_activate` against the activation unit across about 3,800 values × 13 shifts × 4 functions. The compiler tests then run whole programs on the simulator:
- a dense layer spread over 2×2 tiles with padding
- a 3-layer MLP (ReLU → tanh → identity)
- convolutions with max and average pooling
- a round trip through `.s` text

Each result must equal the reference exactly.

## What the schedule achieves

Prefetching hides the weight fetches behind each other, but not behind the arithmetic. A multiply over B rows keeps the array busy for B + 511 cycles, while the next tile needs 1,366 cycles to arrive and 256 to shift in. So a program with small batches waits on DDR3 most of the time:

| Program | Cycles | MXU busy | Waiting for weights |
|---|---|---|---|
| dense.s (16 rows, 1 tile) | 2,352 | 527 (22%) | 1,619 |
| mlp.s (16 rows, 3 tiles) | 5,084 | 1,581 (31%) | 3,293 |
| conv.s (36 pixels, 1 tile) | 2,310 | 547 (24%) | 1,619 |

To keep the array busy, each tile has to be used on over a thousand rows. That happens with large batches, and with convolutions over big images, where every weight is reused at every pixel. For inference on MLPs and LSTMs, where batches are small, TPUv1 is bound by weight bandwidth rather than by arithmetic.
